#Final Project (Quaestus - Working Title)

###-Overview
For our final project we would like to implement a web app called “Questus” where users will be
able to look at a list of exercises and dietary recommendations. The site will have a filter that
lets users look at exercises based around specific body parts and whole regions(upper body
etc…) Each exercise will be accompanied by a gif or picture to demonstrate how it should be
done. Exercises posted on the site will contain a name, a picture/video and written
instructions. In addition to the exercise part of the website, we will also have a page
representing macros and dietary aspects of a healthy lifestyle. This page will contain recipes, a
breakdown of the nutrients, and even specific diets like keto and vegetarian. A login page and
way to store data would also be implemented so that users can view each other's pages. This
would include their liked workouts and a breakdown of their current diet.
